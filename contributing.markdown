# How to Contribute to this Website
The resources section of [InformationDiet.com](http://informationdiet.com) is a [publicly available github repository](https://github.com/cjoh/informationdiet/tree/gh-pages). This means you can fork, edit, and contribute back your own resources. Have a great blog that readers and information dieters should know about? Think there's a great voice that needs to be listened to? Add it!

*Here's how:*

1. [Sign up for a free github account](https://github.com/signup/free)
2. [Visit the Project](https://github.com/cjoh/informationdiet/tree/gh-pages)
3. [Fork it!](https://github.com/cjoh/informationdiet/fork)
4. Find the file you want to edit, and click the edit button.
5. Edit to your heart's content.
6. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/cjoh/informationdiet/pull/new/gh-pages)

If the Information Diet team thinks it belongs in the resources section of the website, it'll get added. Everything in the github repository is freely available content except for what's in the _layouts section.
